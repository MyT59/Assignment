            <h3>Michael Hasudungan Tampubolon</h3>
            <p>“From a young age, the water felt like home. With relentless training and dedication, I achieved my best record: an impressive 30 seconds in a 50-meter swim. This milestone represented countless hours of hard work, early mornings, and a passion for the sport. Swimming taught me the importance of teamwork and resilience as I cheered on fellow athletes while striving for my best. Although I've stepped away from competitive racing, the lessons I learned in the pool remain. Now, as I pursue my goal of becoming a coach, I’m eager to share my knowledge and inspire the next generation of swimmers.”</p>

            <p>a passionate videographer hailing from the vibrant town of Majalengka. With a keen eye for storytelling and a deep appreciation for visual art, I have dedicated my career to capturing moments that resonate and inspire. I began my journey into videography at a young age, driven by a fascination with film and the power of visual narratives.

                Over the years, I have honed my skills in various aspects of videography, including event coverage, promotional content, and creative storytelling. My work often reflects the beauty of my surroundings in Majalengka, showcasing the rich culture and stunning landscapes of this region.</p>

                <p>I developed a love for sports from a young age, starting with swimming at the age of 5. It quickly became a passion, offering me a sense of freedom and tranquility. I enjoy exploring various swimming styles, finding joy in the rhythm of my strokes and the refreshing embrace of the water. Rather than focusing on competition, I have set personal goals to improve my skills and enhance my endurance.

                    At 14, I discovered basketball, which added a new dimension to my athletic journey. The teamwork, strategy, and physical challenges of the game have made it a rewarding experience. I enjoy both playing and watching basketball, as it keeps me active and engaged while teaching me valuable lessons about collaboration and perseverance.
                    
                    My love for swimming has also led me to engage in community programs that promote water safety and encourage children to learn how to swim. I believe swimming is an essential life skill, and I find fulfillment in sharing my passion with others.
                    
                    As I continue my journey in both swimming and basketball, I aim to maintain a balanced approach, incorporating mindfulness and fitness into my routine. I look forward to exploring open-water swimming and further developing my basketball skills, while also helping others discover the joy I've found in these sports..</p>
